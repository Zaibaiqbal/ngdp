                passed in 2010 through a cross-party support and endorsement provides the opportunity to
                ensure that the Constitutional guarantee of equality is achieved by ensuring complete
                autonomy to provinces.47 subjects and 18 federal ministries have been devolved and federal
                and provincial constitutional purviews have been demarcated.The Amendment has entailed
                transferring of resources from the federal level to the provinces to define their priorities and
                accordingly fulfill their responsibilities.The scope of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental
                human rights has also been expanded by the said amendment, namely:a) the right to fair trial
                and due process, b) the right to information and, c) the right to education. With greater
                ownership of policies and programmes a learning and competitive spirit has emerged
